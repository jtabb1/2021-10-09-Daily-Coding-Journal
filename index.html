    <p> 
      Today I made a user interface improvement in the front-end 
      of my coding project that took a little while to figure out. 
      I also worked on my real estate business - the one property 
      that I have to rent out to others and live in myself - I 
      worked on a preparing a legal document for it.

      Tonight I'll work on hosting my site.  I exercised a little this 
      morning but if I am lucky with my work I will get a chance to go to 
      the gym tonight.
